Report service generator and business logic mapper, for providing a RESTful API layer between front-end reporting applications and the OAO Data Warehouse.

Currently using [SQueaLy](https://github.com/hashedin/squealy) to generate API endpoints from parameterized SQL statements. Still a baby, expected to grow into a more sophisticated and automatic tool for generating queries from report requests.
